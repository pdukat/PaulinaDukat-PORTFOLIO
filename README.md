# **PORTFOLIO/Paulina Dukat**

### About me

My name is Paulina Dukat. I am a master of spatial development. I work in the City Office in the Department of Architecture and Urban Planning, where I grant the permissions to build for city infrastructure. I love to travel, especially I'm interested in city tourism. For several years I have been watching the development of the IT industry with curiosity. My husband working in IT said once that I am "the most IT person from no IT people he knows", so I decided to try my hand at software testing. I am determinated to learn and improve my skills to get a junior position in testing.
